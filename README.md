Gigabyte Cafe
=========

This is a project I did for my Java Design Patterns class. 

The objective of this assignment is to develop an application capable of managing and facilitating customer orders, both food and drink, at Gigabyte CafÃ©. The application would need to interact with two separate menus, one for food and one for beverages.

### Four design patterns were used:
- Abstract Factory
- Factory
- Singleton
- Iterator


### Compilation of code
```
javac *

```


### Example Run
```
